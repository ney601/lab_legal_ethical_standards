# Legal and Ethical Standards

## Task

### 1. Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

#### Scenario 1

Yes, as they are violating GDPR regulations by sharing customer data with the payday loan company without consent. Direct marketing can violate consumer protection laws and financial regulations.

#### Scenario 2

They are not breaking any laws explicitly, but there are risks with monetising the game through in-app purchases, especially for underage consumers.

#### Scenario 3

Yes regarding GDPR and data protection laws as the users' location data will be shared for targeted advertising.


### 2. What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

#### Scenario 1

This raises privacy concers and also exploits customers with direct marketing and whilst also deciding not to disclose the partnership.

#### Scenario 2

Monetising the game can lead to addiction and excessive spending, but also giving players who are not willing to pay a disadvantage.

#### Scenario 3

The premium membership defeats the whole purpose of easily creating social connections and can leas to inequality. There is also the risk of exploiting users' personal information and raises privacy concerns when users' location data is shared.


### 3. What could the company do to address these issues?

#### Scenario 1

Enforce the GDPR regulations so that customers can choose to give consent on their data being shared. Make sure BankingCorp can provide more financial solutions to customers instead of partnering with a payday loan company. Also making sure customers are aware of any partnerships with third-party companies.

#### Scenario 2

Only use monetisation to unclock features that won't affect the gameplay and making sure that players have clear information on the costs. The company could also look for other revenue streams that won't affect the gameplay, such as advertisements.

#### Scenario 3

Having a fairer approach such as making sure the essential features are free and be transparent about the costs for a premium membership. Most importantly, they should get consent from users to share their location data for advertisements.
